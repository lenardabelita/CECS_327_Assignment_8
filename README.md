# CECS_327_Assignment_8
This project includes a simple client-server application that connects to a MongoDB database to query sensor data. The server listens for client requests on a specific port and responds with data about moisture, water consumption, and electricity consumption from connected devices.
#instructions
pip install pymongo 
run client.py and server.py 
Once connected, user will be prompted with: 
Average moisture inside the fridge in the last 3 hours.
Average water consumption per dishwasher cycle.
Device with the highest electricity consumption.
